<h1>The Best Character of Genshin Impact According to Dimas Emeraldo</h1>

<h2>Natlan Edition</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>1. Chasca</h3>

<p>Chasca is my first 5 star of natlan and when it comes to explore natlan it's verry satsfaying because she clan fly verry far away.</p>

<h3>2. veressa</h3>
<p>She is natlan electro queen with playstyle like xioa but simpler.</p>

<h3>3. Mavuika</h3>
<p>She is the pyro archon, I hope can get her when the next banner comes.</p>
